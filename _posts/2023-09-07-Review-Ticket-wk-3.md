### Summary of Accomplishments:

> Added WASD keys to Snake
- Asked ChatGPT and understood what code meant and where it was meant to go
Example:

case 65: // 'A' key

    if (snake_dir !== 1) 

        snake_next_dir = 3; 
    break;


> Wrote Linux script that checks for existence of repository and clones from GitHub if not
- Took example from my own Hacks from week 2 and Mr. M's Linux Shell and Bash page and wrote simple Linux commands to download, clone, and look inside given repository
    - Discovered that Jupyter Notebooks does not take inputs in all languages, so adjusted accordingly by defining variables


> Made a table using HTML and JavaScript
- Followed Mr. M's tutorial
