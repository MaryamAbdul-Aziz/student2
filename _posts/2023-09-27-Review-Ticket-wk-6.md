### Summary of Accomplishments

Wednesday:

> Completed HTML Basics 
- Easily created buttons but found button text was yellow
    - Experimented with this and could not change text color no matter what
    - Eventually realized that this was the midnights theme color for links and would not change without changing entire theme 
    - Decided to leave button text as yellow

> Completed JS Basics: Data Types
- Created var 'person' (type: object)
    - Modified as per instructions, changed interests and classes to none
- Did different arithmetic functions with variable numbers
    - Wrote code that I quickly realized was very repetitive and unwieldy. Asked ChatGPT to fix it for me
    - Wrote a function that repeated the name of the operation and then the output
- Wrote 'typeof' code
    - Utilized previous ChatGPT code from previous task and modified it to my purposes
        - Recognized `var i=0` as the number of the string of the `listofVariables` variable
        - Recognized `i++` as i being increased with each case
        - Made changes to code so that it would print the variable and then `variable + "is a " + typeof variable`

Thursday:

> Completed JS Basics with HTML (DOM)
- Worked a little with ChatGPT in class to come up with basic structure of the code
    - Set variables for link href
    - Wrote a function to switch link href upon clicking a button
    - Fixed function to remove `onclick` and instead moved function to button attributes
- Added some additional features to button
    - Switched both link text and link href
    - Changed button text to say  `Working...` while function was running
    - Tried using import.time to add a delay to make the change look human
        - Used ChatGPT's advice and instead used function within a function, `setTimeout()`

> Completed Javascript
- Wrote very basic code that took 2 pre-defined variables and compared them to each other
- Then made code more advanced and changed variables to user input
    - Looked up user input in JavaScript and discovered `prompt()`
    - Learned that I needed to use `parseFloat()` with the user input to change the variables to numbers

> Completed JS Debugging
- Further details within document regarding specific changes
- Accidentally missed `i++` in code and ran into infinite loop that crashed VSCode and later my computer for several hours. Eventually deleted code and waited out the crash
